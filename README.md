=============

Its a dummy project to test how to create continous integration and continous delivery using 5 technologies:

- Git as a version control system.
- Node (as a stand alone server).
- Docker as a containerization tool to be able to scale the application.
- Jenkins as a Testing and deployment tool.
- Google Cloud as a cloud compute engine.
